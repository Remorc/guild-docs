title: Announcement of Guilds

Guilds will be announced soon and there are a few things you should know

We are very excited to be able to write that over the next 7-10 days Guilds will be formally announced to everyone at Pillar.
We are making this move for 2 reasons.  The first is to provide improved support to the individuals in technical roles as
Pillar grows. Craftsmen who are further down the path to craftsmanship should be helping people who are earlier on their
path to craftsmanship. This help will be to create well rounded guild members. The structure and behaviors the Guild system
introduces will be in service of helping ensure that occurs.  The second is to help Delivery and Growth know how to grow teams,
accounts, and Pillar in a healthy way. Guilds will inform healthy team composition, rotation strategy, and growth strategy.
Guilds doing so will give Growth a clearer picture of technology expertise each Guild has to offer.

Several humans at Pillar have been ideating around this change for years. Many of those same humans have recently begun
helping plan this transition. We have been very thoughtful throughout this time, but there is no way possible that we have
accounted for all the fears or questions you will have once specific changes are announced. As we announce the groups, Guild
leaders, and coordination with Delivery you will almost certainly have questions and concerns. We will be taking an iterative
approach to achieve these changes and will be gathering your feedback after each iteration. In this way, we aim to achieve a
sustained and positive outcome for all of usâ€” Pillar.

I look forward to your thoughts over the coming weeks as we all move forward together.
