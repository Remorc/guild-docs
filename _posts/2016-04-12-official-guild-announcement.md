###We are Pillar Guilds

A short time back we wrote to let you know we would be formally announcing Guilds at Pillar. This is that announcement. Contained within you will find an explanation of the composition of each Guild, the ways to get more information about your Guilds, and a reminder of why this change is occurring. Without further ado...

### The Guilds

IHR Guild Leaders
- Kevin Knowles and Dan Putman

GLR Guild Leader

Members - as assigned, will be communicated by Guild Leaders

The initial division of Guilds is based on the current project participation.  The composition of Guilds is expected to change over time.

## How do you learn more and provide feedback?

Your Guild Leader will be scheduling time with all of you to explain in detail what comes next, if they have not done so already. Working directly with your Guild Leader will be the most reliable and responsive source of information. Additionally there will be a discussion of Guilds in the monthly meeting occurring on 4/13 in each region as well as PillarCon. Lastly, you can always email Guild Leaders at guild-leaders@pillartchnology.com.

Guild Leaders are currently meeting weekly and will always discuss feedback and changes at those meetings, allowing for iteration. As you provide feedback expect a response and/or change cadence of 1-2 weeks. If necessary,  escalation can be made to Don Abney via phone or email.

## Tell me again why we are making this change?
We are making this change for 2 reasons. 

* The first is to provide improved support to the individuals in technical roles as Pillar grows. Craftsmen who are further down the path to craftsmanship should be helping people who are earlier on their path to craftsmanship. This help will be to create well rounded Guild members. The structure and behaviors the Guild system introduces will be in service of helping ensure that occurs. As an example, individuals will experience more meaningful career guidance and improved focus on measuring career progression.

* The second is to help Delivery and Growth know how to grow teams, accounts, and Pillar in a healthy way. Guilds will inform healthy team composition, rotation strategy, and growth strategy. Guilds doing so will give Growth a clearer picture of technology expertise each Guild has to offer.

Several humans at Pillar have been ideating around this change for years. Many of those same humans have recently begun helping plan this transition. We have been very thoughtful throughout this time, but there is no way possible that we have accounted for all the fears or questions you will have once specific changes are announced. As we implement the groups, Guild leaders, and coordination with Delivery you will almost certainly have questions and concerns. We will be taking an iterative approach to achieve these changes and will be gathering your feedback after each iteration. In this way, we aim to achieve a sustained and positive outcome for all of usâ€” Pillar.

We look forward to your thoughts over the coming weeks as we all move forward together.
