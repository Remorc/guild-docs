How does the process of moving up a persona become initiated? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)
: The process of moving from one persona to another should be initiated with the help of your mentor. In the absence of a mentor, the most senior artisan on your team or account can step in. During your Career Retro (facilitated by your Account DE and Account Artisan), one topic of conversation should be about your career progression. Using the persona definitions as guidelines, a career plan should be constructed and reviewed during every Career Retro. Currently, the expectation is to have Career Retros on a 6 month cadence.

Who will judge an artisan's behaviors? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)
: Artisans will be treated to individual attention, much like the current new-hire interview process. An artisan's mentor and peer are responsible for giving frequent and honest feedback to help the artisan grow. Once the artisan has been identified, evaluations will be given by Master Craftsmen and Craftsmen, depending on availability and level of the artisan being evaluated.

How will the behaviors be judged (checked off) since some are subjective? [Issue #8](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/8)

Are my promotion qualifications tied heavily to my participation in activities outside of work (community paricipation)? [Inferred, Issue #12](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/12)
: Depends on how you define 'heavily.' Will someone who participates in the community grow and mature in their profession at a faster rate? Experience says 'yes'. So, an artisan that participates in activities outside of their billable time will progress at a faster rate.

Are the years of experience cummulative across the career or just at Pillar? [Inferred, Issue #21](https://github.com/PillarTechnology/guild-docs/issues/21)
