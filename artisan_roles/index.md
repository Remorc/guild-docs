## Summary

We use a scale of Apprentice – Journeyman – Craftsman to describe an artisan's career stage. These levels are inspired by [Apprenticeship Patterns](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html) and other books on Software Craftsmanship, but have specific meaning within Pillar.

- At all levels, Pillar developers are very highly skilled and bring a lot of valuable experience to their teams and projects. We all are enthusiastic about continuously improving our craft, learning from others, and teaching what we know.
- Apprentices have a strong technical foundation and an eagerness to learn the Pillar way of delivering software. With help, they can build really well-crafted solutions in a short period of time.
- Journeymen have demonstrated proficiency applying Pillar engineering practices on an agile team. They've got the chops not just to do excellent work, but also to mentor both teammates and clients.
- Craftsmen have technical skills that are both broad and deep, demonstrating a level of mastery that comes from experience and hard lessons learned. They also have the consulting skills, business acumen, and leadership ability to help their whole team and project flourish.
