title: Being a Candidate for Progression
---

> Please note that the path for progression is something that will continue to evolve over time as we receive feedback, gain additional experience, and grow as a company.

---

## What is the purpose for this process?
*(AKA: Why can't someone simply anoint me as the next Guild Persona?)*

The purpose is to provide you with appropriate feedback and guidance to assist you with your professional growth and development.  In combination with other feedback mechanisms already in place (e.g. Career Retros), the Guilds provide additional structure to help ensure that feedback and mentoring will be available to everyone within the company.

## What is a Candidate for Progression?
A Candidate for Progression is an Artisan who has:

* Demonstrated that he or she is ready for consideration to be moved to the next Guild Persona
* Been sponsored for Candidacy by a Craftsman in his or her Guild

---

## How do I become a Candidate for Progression?
Your Guild Leader and the other Craftsmen in your Guild will be continually on the lookout for people who are ready to become candidates for progression.  Alternatively, if you do not think that you've been identified as a Candidate for Progression but believe that you are ready, you can let your Guild Leader know.

When one of the Craftsmen in your Guild believes you are ready, they will sponsor you as a Candidate for Progression.  Sponsorship is effectively a stamp of approval by the Craftsman saying that, *"I believe that this person has demonstrated that they are ready and should be considered a Candidate for Progression."*

At this point in the process, you might be refused sponsorship and given feedback by your Guild Leader or other Craftsmen in your Guild that there are various items you need to improve upon before you would be a strong Candidate for Progression.  Think of this as a quick retrospective/evaluation with action items that need to be addressed before you're ready to be a Candidate for Progression.

## Why do I need a Sponsor?
Having a Sponsor serves multiple purposes, but the primary purpose is to have someone "by your side" at the Litmus Test.  Your Sponsor will assist you in advocating for your eligibility for progression.

The other major purpose that having a Sponsor serves is acting as a preliminary "screening".  Since the goal of the Litmus Test is for the Craftsmen of your Guild as a whole to agree that you are likely ready for progression and to provide feedback for the Guild Leaders to review, having one who has effectively already said that you are ready is a necessary first step.

## What does it look like to be a Candidate for Progression?
Your experience as a Candidate for Progression will be slightly different, based on which level you are progressing to.  Please reference the section for your particular progression for details specific to that progression.

#### The Litmus Test ####
Regardless of which level for which you are a Candidate for Progression, you will be invited to a Litmus Test meeting.  This will be one of the periodic meetings of the Craftsmen within your Guild, with your Litmus Test as the agenda.  This is important in order to help norm on and maintain a consistency in the understanding of *"what it means to be performing as this persona"* within a Guild.

During the meeting, ***all of the prerequisites for all the personas up through the one progression you are to be a candidate for*** will be discussed, and how well you meet them will be evaluated.  For example, if you are a candidate for progressing from Journeyman to Craftsman, all of the prerequisites for "Apprentice", "Apprentice to Journeyman", and "Journeyman to Craftsman" would be evaluated.

To facilitate this process, ***please bring any examples or other artifacts that you might have that help demonstrate your proficiency for the various prerequisites***.  Having examples and artifacts will allow the evaluation to be more objective and grounded in the data and evidence of proficiency.

If there are Craftsmen from other Guilds who you feel would provide useful insight into your abilities, please request that they be invited to your Litmus Test.  A representative from Delivery will also be invited to participate in your Litmus Test (either the DL on your team or the DM/DE on your account).

#### The Guild Leader Review ####
For some levels of progression (e.g. Journeyman to Craftsman), a review of the results from the Litmus Test is performed by the Guild Leaders before a recommendation to Delivery is made.  This is important at the higher level personas in order to help norm on and maintain a consistency of evaluation and understanding of *"what it means to be performing as this persona"* across Guilds.

### From Apprentice to Journeyman
Each of the following signifies a step in the process.  Your progression is not complete until the last step has been completed.

1. You will need to gain sponsorship from a Craftsman within your Guild to become a Candidate for Progression from Apprentice to Journeyman.
2. Your Litmus Test will be scheduled with the Craftsmen of your Guild (and any Craftsmen from other Guilds that you have requested to be invited).
3. If there are action items coming out of your Litmus Test, then your candidacy ends.  You will need to take those items and demonstrate improvement toward them before you will be again sponsored as a Candidate for Progression.
4. If the result of your Litmus Test is that the Craftsmen of the Guild agree that you are a good Candidate for Progression, then your Guild Leader will recommend to Delivery that you are ready to make the move from Apprentice to Journeyman.
5. Your Guild Leader will work with Delivery to determine when this move can happen.
***Please note that, based on various factors, an immediate move is not always possible.***
6. After final approvals have been obtained and paperwork has been completed, only then will the progression to Journeyman be completed.

### From Journeyman to Craftsman
Each of the following signifies a step in the process.  Your progression is not complete until the last step has been completed.

1. You will need to gain sponsorship from a Craftsman within your Guild to become a Candidate for Progression from Journeyman to Craftsman.
2. Your Litmus Test will be scheduled with the Craftsmen of your Guild (and any Craftsmen from other Guilds that you have requested to be invited).
3. If there are action items coming out of your Litmus Test, then your candidacy ends.  You will need to take those items and demonstrate improvement toward them before you will be again sponsored as a Candidate for Progression.
4. If the result of your Litmus Test is that the Craftsmen of the Guild agree that you are a good Candidate for Progression, then your Guild Leader will present your candidacy and the evaluation results to the other Guild Leaders for review.
5. If there are action items coming out of the Guild Leader Review, then your candidacy ends.  You will need to take those items and demonstrate improvement toward them before you will be again sponsored as a Candidate for Progression.
6. If the result of your Guild Leader Review is that the Guild Leaders agree that you are a good Candidate for Progression, then your Guild Leader will recommend to Delivery that you are ready to make the move from Journeyman to Craftsman.
7. Your Guild Leader will work with Delivery to determine when this move can happen.
***Please note that, based on various factors, an immediate move is not always possible.***
8. After final approvals have been obtained and paperwork has been completed, only then will the progression to Craftsman be completed.

### From Craftsman to Master Craftsman
What this looks like is still to be determined.

### Re-certifying Your Standing as a Master Craftsman
What this looks like is still to be determined.

## What if I have concerns over how my Candidacy for Progression is being handled?
If you have concerns over how your Candidacy for Progression is being handled, please follow the below escalation process.  Note that attempting to jump ahead in the escalation process is only going to result in all of the previous conversations happening anyway, so there is nothing to be gained by ignoring the escalation process.

1. Your first point of escalation is your Guild Leader.  You should start by explaining to him/her your situation and concerns.
2. If you feel that your concerns have not been addressed by your Guild Leader, the second point of escalation is your DL or another Guild Leader, whichever of the two you feel more comfortable bringing this to.  If you contact your DL, they will bring this to the attention of both your Guild Leader as well as another Guild Leader, who will help facilitate discussion and resolution of your concerns.  It is possible that the Guild Leaders will also bring this to the attention of all the other Guild Leaders, for a larger discussion.
3. If you still feel that your concerns have not been addressed, your third point of escalation is the Delivery Executive on your account.  They will bring this to the attention of your Guild Leader, the Guild Leader involved at the second escalation point, and at least one other Guild Leader that has not yet been involved in the escalation.  It is likely that this will subsequently be brought to the attention of all of the other Guild Leaders at this point (if this has not already happened), for a larger discussion.  It is also likely that the Delivery Executive will remain involved in the conversations that are happening.
4. If nothing has addressed your concerns by this point, please escalate to HR, so they can help facilitate the necessary conversations to understand what the situation is from everyone's perspectives.
