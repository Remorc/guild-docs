title: Being a Candidate for Progression
---

> Please note that the path for progression is something that will continue to evolve over time as we receive feedback, gain additional experience, and grow as a company.

---

## What is the purpose for this process?
*(AKA: Why can't someone simply anoint me as the next Guild Persona?)*

The purpose is to provide you with appropriate feedback and guidance to assist you with your professional growth and development.  In combination with other feedback mechanisms already in place (e.g. Career Retros), the Guilds provide additional structure to help ensure that feedback and mentoring will be available to everyone within the company.

---

## What is a Candidate for Progression?
A Candidate for Progression is an Artisan who has:

* Demonstrated that he or she is ready for consideration to be moved to the next Guild Persona
* Been sponsored for Candidacy by a Craftsman within his or her Guild (or outside of their Guild if they are working closely with the Craftsman)

---

## How do I become a Candidate for Progression?
Your Guild Leader and the other Craftsmen in your Guild will be continually on the lookout for people who are ready to become candidates for progression.  Alternatively, you can let your Guild Leader know if you think you're ready.

You'll need a Sponsor who will act as your advocate during the process. Sponsorship is effectively a stamp of approval by the Craftsman saying that, *"I believe that this person has demonstrated that they are ready and should be considered a Candidate for Progression."*

At this point in the process, you might be refused sponsorship and given feedback by your Guild Leader or other Craftsmen in your Guild that there are various items you need to improve upon before you would be a strong Candidate for Progression.  Think of this as a quick retrospective/evaluation with action items that need to be addressed before you're ready to be a Candidate for Progression.

---

## Why do I need a Sponsor?
A Sponsor's primary purpose is to be an advocate; someone "by your side" at the Litmus Test.  Your Sponsor will help lay out specifics of your eligibility for progression.

Sponsors also act as a preliminary "screening". Your Sponsor must consider you ready for progression before proceeding, so this is an effective way of getting quick feedback (and endorsement!) before moving further in the process.

---

## What does it look like to be a Candidate for Progression?
Your experience as a Candidate for Progression will be slightly different, based on which level you are progressing to.  A Litmus Test meeting determines whether you're ready for progression.

### Understanding the Litmus Test ###

Every artisan level progression involves a Litmus Test meeting. The Litmus Test meeting is a conversation to determine if you're ready to step up to the next persona level. The Litmus Test ensures the Guilds maintain consistency in the understanding of *"what it means to be performing as this persona"* within a Guild.

Litmus Test attendees include you, your Sponsor, the Guild's leader(s), any other advocates you want to invite, and potentially other Craftsmen from your Guild. Delivery (DLs, DEs, etc.) may also take part.

It's **critical** you understand the Litmus Test is *not* a stump the dummy grillfest. The Litmus Test is a collaborative discussion on your strengths and value to yourself and Pillar. Moreover, you'll receive specific feedback on how you can improve yourself.

#### Prepairing for the Litmus Test ####

There are a number of things you'll need to do as part of preparing for your Litmus Test:

* Get a Sponsor
* Coordinate with your Guild Leader(s)
* Review requirements for the role you're progressing to
* Assemeble examples, artifacts, etc. that will help show your progress
* Speak to other advocates you'd like to be part of your Litmus Test discussion (other Craftsmen, account Amigos, etc.)

#### The Litmus Test Meeting ####

During the meeting, ***all of the prerequisites for all the personas up through the one progression you are to be a candidate for*** will be discussed and evaluated.  For example, if you are a candidate for progressing from Journeyman to Craftsman, all of the prerequisites for "Apprentice", "Apprentice to Journeyman", and "Journeyman to Craftsman" would be evaluated.

During the meeting the group will come to a consensus on whether or not you're ready for advancement.

If the decision is you're not ready, then the group will come up with *specific* action items for you to accomplish.

You should expect to spend three to four hours, possibly more, in the Litmus Test.

#### Review by Guild Leaders ####
For some levels of progression (e.g. Journeyman to Craftsman), a review of the results from the Litmus Test is performed by the Guild Leaders before a recommendation to Delivery is made.  This is important at the higher level personas in order to help norm on and maintain a consistency of evaluation and understanding of *"what it means to be performing as this persona"* across Guilds.

## Role Advancement Processes

### Apprentice to Journeyman, and Journeyman to Craftsman

Each of the following steps are required.

1. Gain sponsorship from a Craftsman within your Guild
2. Contact your Guild Leader to schedule the Litmus Test
3. Go through the Litmus Test
  * For Apprentice to Journeyman, this happens with the Craftsmen of your Guild, your DL, your TL, and your Sponsor
  * For Journeyman to Craftsman, this also includes a subsequent review with the Guild Leaders
4. If the result of your Litmus Test is you're not yet ready, this part of your progression stops. You'll need to address the resulting action items and schedule a follow-on Litmus Test
5. If the result of your Litmus Test is you're ready, then your Guild Leader will work with Delivery to determine when this move can happen.
***Please note that, based on various factors, an immediate move is not always possible.***
6. After final approvals have been obtained and paperwork has been completed, your DL/DM/DE will meet with you and discuss the details of your progression with you.  Only then will the candidacy for progression be completed.

## What if I have concerns over how my Candidacy for Progression is being handled?
If you have concerns over how your Candidacy for Progression is being handled, please follow the below escalation process.  Note that attempting to jump ahead in the escalation process is only going to result in all of the previous conversations happening anyway, so there is nothing to be gained by ignoring the escalation process.

1. Your first point of escalation is your Guild Leader.  You should start by explaining to him/her your situation and concerns.
2. If you feel that your concerns have not been addressed by your Guild Leader, the second point of escalation is your DL or another Guild Leader, whichever of the two you feel more comfortable bringing this to.  If you contact your DL, they will bring this to the attention of both your Guild Leader as well as another Guild Leader, who will help facilitate discussion and resolution of your concerns.  It is possible that the Guild Leaders will also bring this to the attention of all the other Guild Leaders, for a larger discussion.
3. If you still feel that your concerns have not been addressed, your third point of escalation is the Delivery Executive on your account.  They will bring this to the attention of your Guild Leader, the Guild Leader involved at the second escalation point, and at least one other Guild Leader that has not yet been involved in the escalation.  It is likely that this will subsequently be brought to the attention of all of the other Guild Leaders at this point (if this has not already happened), for a larger discussion.  It is also likely that the Delivery Executive will remain involved in the conversations that are happening.
4. If nothing has addressed your concerns by this point, please escalate to HR, so they can help facilitate the necessary conversations to understand what the situation is from everyone's perspectives.
