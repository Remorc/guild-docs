### What is the purpose of the Guilds?
Guilds, at Pillar, provide the mechanism for advancing through our stages of Apprentice, Journeyman, Craftsman, and, ultimately, Master Craftsman. At every stage of advancement, a Guild member joins with a sponsor who will shepherd them through the process – both of whom take responsibility for their role in the partnership. It is the responsibility of Guild leadership to ensure that this process is followed effectively, and each sponsor will communicate their progress on a regular basis. Further, the Guild is responsible to each and every member—ensuring they know exactly what Pillar expects of them in each role.

In addition to tracking advancement sponsorships, Guild leadership will meet regularly with each member to track and advise them on their individual professional growth. Pillar is a learning organization and we want our Guilds to provide not only a central repository of knowledge and experience, but guidance to each member on how to improve themselves in both hard and soft skills required of a Pillar consultant. By keeping up with each member’s professional progress, we can also assist them in being placed in more desirable client engagements.

Finally, the Guilds also provide members with different avenues of improving their skills. A member of the Guild may act as a mentor to another, based on relative levels of proficiency with a given area. A mentoring relationship will normally require regular and specific communications take place between the partners.

The Guild can also provide a friendly audience for those members who wish to improve their public presentation skills or to hone a talk they wish to give. Guild members are encouraged to use the Guild to fine-tune presentations intended for PluggedIn events, PillarCon, local user groups, or even large industry conferences.
